# About cardnected
The ongoing pandemic has hugely impacted our social life.  Loneliness kills, and a recent study reported that there's a significant increase in loneliness during the pandemic ([Viviana Horigian, 2020]). More than 7 in 10 adults said the pandemic has made it more difficult for them to connect with friends, resulting in an absence of meaningful social relationships ([AARP & United Health Foundation, 2020]). 

We believe that happiness is the key to everything. And having more social interactions led to greater happiness and wellbeing. Researcher has found that you can build a sense of closeness and intimacy just by asking and answering to deep questions and cardnected is here to help.

Cardnected is a card conversation game platform providing sets of deep questions designed to build up a valuable experience by creating meaningful conversations. We aim to remove the barriers to building new or strengthening the existing connections online, <b>Enabling happiness at home, #StayAtHome </b>

Talk to Anyone, Stay Connected.
